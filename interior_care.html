                    After vacuuming, take a soft-bristled brush or a microfiber cloth and use it to dust off the
                    dashboard, center console, and door panels. By doing this, any loose dirt or debris will be removed,
                    and the surfaces will be ready for a more thorough cleaning.

                      Seat belts are often neglected during cleaning because they are not visible all the time. However,
                      they are frequently touched objects in a car and can easily get dirty from spilled food, coffee, or
                      hand cream. To clean them, you can use a soft-bristled brush with dish soap and warm water. After
                      scrubbing, rinse with water and use a clean towel to remove any excess water. This will keep the
                      seat belts clean and free from germs.

                        Cleaning the interior of a car can be an easy task if done correctly. To effectively clean surfaces
                        like the dashboard and door panels, you can use an all-purpose cleaner or a product made specially
                        for car interiors. Simply apply the cleaner or product onto a microfiber cloth and gently wipe the
                        surfaces, removing any dust, fingerprints, or stains. To give the surfaces a shiny finish and
                        provide long-lasting protection, you can use an interior protectant.
