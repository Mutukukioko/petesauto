                    Motor vehicles are machines just like any other and therefore undergo wear and tear, and should be
                    serviced regularly for effective performance and enhanced lifespan.
                    The engine being the 'heart' of the vehicle, it should be taken good care of. Engine servicing is
                    one of the key tips of maintaining your engine. This ensures that your vehicle's engine is always
                    alive.

                <h2>What's an engine oil service?</h2>
                <p>
                    An engine oil service is an oil change service whereby the used dirty oil is drained and the engine
                    is refilled with fresh clean oil.
                    This ensures that all moveable engine components are well lubricated and function effectively.

                <h2>When do I service my engine?</h2>
                <p>
                    Generally, your vehicle's engine should be serviced at least once a year. However, depending on your
                    vehicle's handbook, some vehicles may be serviced even after two years.
                    Time to service your engine can also be determined by the distance covered. This will vary depending
                    on the quantity and type of engine oil used. A busy-schedule vehicle covers several miles within a
                    short time, and therefore needs to be serviced more often as compared to a car that is usually at
                    the parking the whole day.

                    Always listen to your engine. Be keen to notice tiny details or sounds that your engine might
                    produce. Treat your vehicle like an infant. It cannot speak, but it can send out signals.

                            Growth in technology has brought about development in the motor industry. Modern

                            been advanced to send clear warning information to the driver.

                            The dashboard warning light can also appear together with another appropriate warning light
                            such as the <i>'CHECK ENGINE LIGHT'</i>. This may not be a reminder for a service, but your
                            engine
                            may be experiencing an issue and needs to be inspected.

                            Always pay attention to your engine idling. If your engine is noisy or produces unusual
                            sounds, it could be time to get it serviced or a fault that needs to be checked out. This
                            could be an onset of a problem that if ignored, could be catastrophic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Strange noises should be addressed immediately by a specialized mechanic.
                            Some noises may be less urgent, but you should be sure of; the exact source of sound, how
                            they sound like, and when the sound occurs.
                            Hissing sound from your bonnet could be a sign of an overheating engine.

                <h2>Importance Of Engine Oil Service.</h2>
                <h3>Why should I service my engine?</h3>
                <p>
                    The engine is the 'heart' of your vehicle since it facilitates its movement. It requires proper
                    lubrication to function effectively and have a longer lifespan. Engine oil is the lubricant that
                    ensures all the moving components of your vehicle are working efficiently. Depending on the engine
                    in your vehicle, there are two types of engine oils: diesel engine oils and petroleum engine
                    oils.Gradually, the oil gets contaminated with dirt,debris and other particles that are unhealthy
                    for the engine.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Regular engine oil service is important for various reasons, which include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduces friction, prevents overheating, and minimizes wear and tear.</li>
                    <li>Increases the performance of your engine.</li>
                    <li>Extends the lifespan of your engine.</li>
                    <li>Improves fuel efficiency and reduces emissions.</li>
                    <li>Provides room for inspection of other components of your engine such as worn out parts, leakages
                        and loose bolts.</li>
                </ul>

                        <p>
                            The servicing of your engine should be done at regular intervals. This will help you do away
                            with harmful used oil and refresh your engine with clean oil. Engine oil lubricates all the
                            moveable parts of your engine, thus reducing friction and minimizing wear and tear. Draining
                            used oil from the engine gets rid of dirt, debris and other particles that might damage it.
                            Additionally, you should check your engine oil level on a daily basis.

                            Spark plugs are responsible for the combustion process in the engine. As their name
                            suggests, they produce sparks that ignite the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber.
                            Regular maintenance is important to extend their lifespan and ensure that the engine retains
                            its spark. Depending on their condition,some spark plugs can be cleaned to remove
                            accumulated soot, while worn out plugs should be replaced. You should keep in mind that
                            neglecting spark plug maintenance can lead to poor engine performance,reduced fuel
                            economy,and even engine misfiring. Therefore, it is advisable to regularly inspect and
                            replace worn-out spark plugs in order to ensure your vehicle runs smoothly and efficiently.

                        <strong><b>Check Engine Light.</b></strong>
                        <p>
                            The Check Engine light appears on your vehicle's dashboard when the vehicle's computer
                            system detects an issue with the engine or emissions. This could be due to a variety of
                            reasons such as a loose gas cap, malfunctioning sensor, or even a more serious problem with
                            the engine or transmission. It is advisable to have your vehicle diagnosed using an OBD
                            Scanner, which can read and interpret the errors in your vehicle's computer system. This
                            will help the mechanic determine the exact problem with your engine.

                        <strong><b>Engine Overheating Problems.</b></strong>
                        <p>
                            If your vehicle's engine is overheating, it means that its temperature has exceeded the
                            recommended limit.This can be due to a variety of factors, such as a faulty thermostat,low
                            coolant level, or a malfunctioning cooling system. It is important to sort out this issue as
                            continued operation of an overheating engine can cause serious damages or even complete
                            failure. It is advisable to switch off your engine for about half an hour or more, to allow
                            it to cool before the mechanic can attend to it.

                        <p>
                            Engine knocking occurs when the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber is not burning
                            correctly. This can be caused by various factors such as insufficient fuel supply, dirty
                            fuel injectors, worn out spark plugs or low engine oil pressure. It is important to have
                            your engine checked as soon as possible to prevent further damages that may result from
                            ignorance.

                        <strong><b> Increased Fuel Consumption.</b></strong>
                        <p>
                            An abnormal increase in your car's fuel consumption is a sign of a malfunctioning engine
                            component. This may be caused by a faulty fuel line. However,if the 'Check Engine Light' on
                            your dashboard is illuminated,it confirms that your engine has a problem.

                        <strong><b>Oil Leakage.</b></strong>
                        <p>
                            Oil leaks from your engine can be a warning sign of a malfunctioning engine part, a worn-out
                            seal or gasket. Ignoring an oil leak can lead to serious damages to the engine, which can be
                            expensive to repair or replace. It is therefore advisable to have any oil leak inspected
                            immediately and repaired by a specialized mechanic.

                        <p>
                            Rough idling of your vehicle's engine can be due to a variety of factors. These may include;
                            worn-out or damaged spark plugs,faulty fuel injectors,clogged air filter, or even a
                            malfunctioning exhaust system. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed as soon as
                            it arises.

                        <p>
                            The main cause of engine vibrations is a faulty spark plug or wire. Faulty spark plugs will
                            cause your vehicle's engine to misfire thus resulting to vibrations and noise. The noise in
                            question is the knocking sound, which can be corrected by cleaning or replacing the spark
                            plugs.Ignoring this sign can result in costly damages that will be expensive to repair.

                        <p>
                            Engine stalling can occur during idling or even at high RPM. In both cases,your vehicle's
                            engine could be lacking sufficient fuel supply. This is caused by a faulty fuel system. In
                            case you experience frequent engine stalling, it is advisable to get your vehicle's engine
                            checked immediately.

                        <strong><b> Smoky Exhaust Fumes.</b></strong>
                        <p>
                            Smoky emissions from your vehicle's exhaust can be caused by faulty fuel injectors, which
                            could either be adding too much fuel, or that the intake valves are not letting in enough
                            air. The causes of all these is leaking fuel injectors, a faulty fuel pressure regulator or
                            a clogged air filter. If you notice your vehicle is smoking, you should get it checked
                            immediately to avert serious engine problems.
