      <h1>Car Suspension System</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h2>What's a car suspension?</h2>
    <p>This is a crucial vehicle component that helps provide a smooth and comfortable ride for the driver and
      passengers by absorbing shocks and vibrations produced by tyres and uneven road surfaces. The suspension system
      mechanically links the body of the car to the wheels and tyres, controls the movement of the car, and maintains
      contact of the tyres with the road surface. The suspension system of a car typically comprises several components,
      including springs, shock absorbers, struts, control arms, and sway bars. These parts work in tandem to enhance the
      vehicle's handling, stability, and ride comfort.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Functions of each component of the suspension system.</h2>
    <p>The suspension setup comprises of several components like springs, shock absorbers, struts, control arms, and
      sway bars. Each of these components perform a specific role to ensure the driver and passengers have a smooth and
      comfortable ride.
      The function of each component is as discussed below;</p>
    <ol class="alphabet-list">
      <li>)
        <b>Springs.</b>
        <p>Suspension springs act as a link between the body of the car and wheels.
          They are primarily tasked to compensate unbalanced road surfaces and thus provide a comfortable ride.
          They also ensure that all wheels have a good grip on the road regardless of their state.</p>

        </div>
      </li>
      <li>)
        <b>Shock absorber.</b>
        <p>The shock absorber is an important component of the suspension system.
          Just like the name suggests, they help to absorb the compression force from springs and prevent the car from
          bouncing on the road.
          They control the unnecessary excess spring motion.
          They also ensure that your tyres are in contact with the road surface at all times.</p>
          <div class="text-center">

        </div>
      </li>
      <li>)
        <b>Control arm.</b>
        <p>This is a crucial component in the vehicle's suspension system. It links the steering knuckle and wheel hub
          to the frame of the vehicle.
          The main function of the control arm is to ensure that wheels are properly aligned and maintain stability
          during driving.</p>
          <br>

      <br>
      <li>)
        <b>Bushes.</b>
        <p>A car bush is a cushion made of rubber, polyurethane or other materials.
          Bushes are fitted onto the suspension system of a vehicle so as to absorb shock, control movement within the
          joints,reduce vibrations and noise, thus enhancing comfort.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img src="service images/bushes.jpg" alt="image here" width="250">
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>)
        <b>Ball joint.</b>
        <p>Ball joints act as a pivot between the control arms and the steering knuckles, allowing for the up and down
          movement of the suspension while still maintaining a connection between the wheels and the steering system.
          This ensures a safe, smooth ride, and also allows the driver to have full control of the vehicle.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
          <img src="service images/ball_joint.jpg" alt="image here" width="250">
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>)
        <b>Sway bar.</b>
        <p>Sway bar,also known as <b><i>Anti-Sway bar,Roll bar</i> </b>or <b><i>Anti-Roll bar </i></b>is part of the
          vehicle's suspension system that prevents the car from rolling when maneuvering through corners or uneven road
          surfaces.
          It links the right and left control arms, and also distributes the weight of the vehicle evenly between the
          wheels. </p>
        <p>For instance, when a vehicle is going through a corner, the vehicle will tend to lean to one side due to
          shifting in weight. This will cause the suspension on that side to compress.
          The sway bar transfers some of that weight to the other side of the suspension, helping to keep the vehicle
          leveled,thus preventing the vehicle from rolling.</p>
          
          <div class="text-center">
          <img src="service images/sway_bar.jpg" alt="image here" width="250">
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>)
        <b>Strut.</b>
        <p>Struts are part of the suspension system that gives it structural support, host the spring, and ensure the
          wheels are properly aligned.
          They also bear much of the side load placed on the vehicle's suspension.
          They play a great role in providing a comfortable ride,and the driver is able to maintain control of the
          vehicle.</p>

      <h2>Common Suspension Problems.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="bad_suspension">

    <h3>How do I know that my suspension is bad?</h3>
    <p>
      A vehicle's suspension system plays a crucial role in providing a comfortable and smooth ride to the driver and
      passengers, making it an essential component.
      It also helps the driver to maintain control and give the vehicle stability.
      The suspension system is made up of several components including springs, struts, shock absorbers, and other parts
      that function cohesively to dampen shocks and vibrations from the road and tyres.
    </p>
    <p>Even though modern vehicles are fitted with suspension systems that are durable and reliable, that does not
      exempt them from experiencing problems due to wear and tear,damage, or other issues.
      Some of the common problems that affect the suspension system include worn out or damaged components, leaks,
      faulty alignment, noisy suspension, and a lowered or uneven ride height.</p>
    <p>
      These issues not only jeopardize the security of the vehicle but also affect the convenience of the individuals
      traveling inside the vehicle.
      It is important to address suspension issues immediately they arise, or rather get it serviced regularly by a
      specialized mechanic.
    </p>
    <ol class="roman-list">
      <li data-roman="I">
        <b> Tyres wearing out unevenly.</b>
        <p>Uneven wearing out of tyres is often a result of suspension issues, specifically improper wheel alignment or
          worn-out suspension components.
          When your vehicle's suspension system is faulty or worn out, it can lead to your tyres wearing out
          irregularly.
          Irregular wearing out of tyres can also be caused by driving on rough terrain or bumpy roads.</p>
          <div class="text-center">
            <img src="service images/wearing_tyre.jpg" alt="image here" width="250">
          </div>
      </li>
      <li data-roman="II">
        <b>Noisy suspension.</b>
        <p>A noisy suspension could be due to a variety of reasons such as worn out shock absorbers, struts, mountings,
          ball joints, or even loose bolts.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-roman="III">
        <b>Vehicle experiences jolts or shocks over bumps.</b>
        <p>The suspension system protects the driver and passengers by absorbing shocks and vibrations caused by uneven
          road surfaces and tyres.
          If your shocks, springs, or struts are worn out, your vehicle may bounce excessively over bumps and uneven
          road surfaces. Additionally, your vehicle may have excessive forward nose-diving when braking. This can result
          in significant discomfort while driving. You can confirm the condition of your suspension system by pressing
          down on your car's bonnet or boot area.
          A good suspension system will raise your car back to its normal level.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-roman="IV">
        <b>Vehicle tilts when parked.</b>
        <p>
          Your vehicle should sit flat and leveled when parked on an even surface. If you notice your vehicle tends to
          lean towards one side or wheel,your suspension system could be faulty or worn out.
          Worn out suspension system can also cause your vehicle to lean forward or backward. The simplest way to
          inspect your vehicle's suspension condition is to check the space between the body of the car and each tyre.
          The space should be the same all round the car.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-roman="V">
        <b>Challenging and shaky steering.</b>
        <p>
          The suspension and steering systems are directly linked to each other. If a component of your suspension
          system is damaged or worn out, your vehicle is likely to sway around instead of maintaining a straight line or
          feel loose while you steer.
          Difficulty steering can also be caused by other factors such as a faulty steering rack, loose steering belt,
          or even low level of steering fluid.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li data-roman="VI">
        <b>Greasy shock absorbers.</b>
        <p>Leaking shock absorbers can result in excessive bouncing of your vehicle, leading to difficulty in
          controlling. Driving on rough terrain or bumpy roads causes wear and tear that leads to leaking shock
          absorbers.
          When you notice your shock absorber is oily or greasy, probably it is leaking and needs to be serviced.
          Servicing of the suspension system should be done as a whole. All the suspensions should be checked.</p>

      <li data-roman="VII">
        <b>Bumpy ride.</b>
        <p>
          If a vehicle has a worn out or a damaged suspension system, it can cause a very uncomfortable ride for the
          passengers. The suspension system is created to maintain contact between the wheels and the road, while also
          reducing the impact of rough surfaces such as bumps, potholes, and uneven terrain.
          If the suspension system is faulty, the passengers will feel every bump and jolt in the road and the ride will
          be very rough and bumpy. This can also cause the vehicle to sway or bounce excessively, making it harder to
          control and increasing the risk of accidents.
          Additionally, a worn-out suspension system can also cause uneven tire wear and reduced vehicle stability,
          which can further compromise the safety of the vehicle and its passengers.

      <li data-roman="VIII">
        <b>The vehicle drifting to one side.</b>
        <p>
          When your vehicle is pulling you to one side while driving, it could be a sign of a faulty suspension system.
          The suspension system links the wheels to the frame of the vehicle, providing stability and absorbing any
          shocks or vibrations generated from uneven road surfaces.
          If your vehicle's suspension system is faulty, it can cause it to pull to one side. One of the common causes
          of a vehicle pulling to one side is a worn out or damaged suspension component such as the sway bar, tie rod
          or control arm.
          This type of damage can result in one wheel tilting to a different direction from the other, leading to an
          imbalance that causes the car to pull to one side.

      </li>
      <li data-roman="IX">
        <b>The vehicle tilting during turning.</b>
        <p>If your vehicle is rolling to one side when cornering, it could be an indication of a faulty suspension
          system. The suspension system of a vehicle ensures a comfortable drive by absorbing shocks and vibrations
          while also ensuring the vehicle stays balanced and steady during movement.
          It also ensures your vehicle's tyres are in contact with the road surface. The common causes of a vehicle
          rolling to one when cornering is worn out shock absorbers, damaged springs, struts, or a problem with the
          chassis.</p>
      </li>
      <li data-roman="X">
        <b>Poor braking efficiency.</b>
        <p>Worn out shock absorbers and struts can adversely affect the performance of your brakes. Your vehicle's
          braking distance may increase, which can be dangerous in an emergency braking situation. You also risk
          skidding on wet or slippery road surfaces.
          You should get your vehicle's shock absorbers and struts checked as soon as possible to avert further damages
          or cases of accidents.</p>

        <h2>Types of Suspension systems.</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Vehicle suspension systems are responsible for supporting the weight of the vehicle and absorbing shock caused by
        bumps and rough roads. There are several types of suspension systems used in vehicles, each with their own unique
        characteristics and advantages.
        Some of the most common suspension systems include independent suspension, solid axle suspension, air suspension,
        and adaptive suspension. The choice of suspension system depends on the type of vehicle, intended use, and desired
        ride quality.
        Understanding the different types of suspension systems can help vehicle owners make informed decisions when it
        comes to choosing the best suspension system for their needs.
      </p>
  
      <ol class="alphabet-list">
        <li>) &nbsp;<b>Independent Suspension system.</b>
          <p>
            Just like the name suggests, this type of suspension system is set to allow each wheel of the vehicle to
            vertically move independently while the vehicle is in motion especially on an uneven road surface or rough
            terrain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compression force exerted on one wheel will not affect the other since their wheel hubs are not mechanically
            linked to each other. In most vehicles, independent suspension systems are used on the front wheels.
            An independent suspension system is designed to have less weight on the wheels, which results in better
            handling and smoother rides. This type of system is also space-efficient, making it easy to steer and less
            heavy.

            Most of the modern vehicles are fitted with <b><i>independent front suspension (IFS)</i></b>. Some also have
            an <b><i>independent rear suspension (IRS)</i></b>. A vehicle which all its suspensions are independent is
            said to have a <b><i>fully independent suspension</i></b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ancient vehicles were fitted with independent suspension systems that used swing <b><i>axles</i></b>, but with
            growth and development in the automobile industry, modern independent suspension systems use
            <b><i>Chapman</i></b> or <b><i>MacPherson Struts, multi-link, trailing arms,</i></b> or
            <b><i>wishbones</i></b>.

          <h6>Double Wishbone Suspension system.</h6>
          <p>
            This is a type of suspension system used in vehicles that allow for independent movement of each wheel. It
            consists of two wishbone- shaped arms that are attached to the chassis of the vehicle at two points and to the
            wheel at one point. By having the shock absorber and coil spring connected to the wishbone, the suspension
            system can effectively manage the up-and-down movement of the wheels.
            This design enables the suspension to regulate important factors that can impact the car's performance,
            including camber and caster angles, as well as the roll center height. These adjustments can significantly
            influence the car's handling and stability.

            <h6>Trailing-arm Suspension system.</h6>
            <p>
              The Trailing-arm, also known as <b><i>trailing-link</i></b>, is a suspension system used in vehicles and
              aircraft that consists of one or more horizontal arms placed in front of the axle on the chassis. These arms
              are connected to the wheels or axle using pivot joints.
              This system is frequently used in the rear wheels of vehicles, but it can also be seen in the front and main
              landing gear of airplanes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Semi trailing-arms are a variation of this suspension system commonly found in front-wheel drive vehicles,
              allowing for a flatter rear floor pan.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leading arms are a type of horizontal arm that connects the wheels to the vehicle structure through pivot
              joints located at the rear of the wheels. They are commonly found on the front axle or wheels of specific
              vehicles like the Citroen 2CV and DS, as well as the M422 Mighty Mite Jeep.

            <h6>MacPherson Strut.</h6>
            <p>
              This is a type of front wheel suspension system found in modern vehicles, which uses the top of a telescopic
              damper to serve as the upper pivot point for steering.
              The name of the design is derived from the inventor and developer's name, <b>Earle S. MacPherson</b>, who
              was
              a prominent American automotive engineer.

            <h6>Multi-link Suspension system.</h6>
            <p>
              This is a type of independent suspension system used in vehicles, which includes one or more longitudinal
              arms. Such suspensions can have three or more control links that provide enhanced stability and handling of
              the vehicle.
              The arms in this suspension system may not necessarily be of equal length and could be angled differently.
              This suspension system was first seen in the late 1960s in the Mercedes-Benz C111 and has later been used in
              their W201 and W124 series of vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a multi-link suspension system, the arms are connected using either spherical joints or rubber bushings
              that can only respond to tension and compression loads, not bending.
              Additionally, some systems may include a trailing or control arm that has two bushings at one end. The tie
              rod
              is responsible for linking the steering box or rack to the wheel hub, replacing one of the lateral arms in
              front suspension systems.
              The solid axle multi-link system is a more affordable and less complicated option than the independent
              multi-link system, as it provides similar advantages in terms of mechanical strength and dependability. This
              system is designed to offer excellent resistance and can be relied upon to perform consistently well over
              time.

              This is an independent rear suspension design that was originally used in lightweight vehicles such as
              sports
              and racing cars. Colin Chapman of Lotus popularized the suspension system characterized by a long upright
              strut that incorporates a coil spring and a shock absorber.
              The lower link of the suspension also doubles as a universal-jointed drive shaft.

            <b>Dependent Suspension system.</b>
            <p>
              A dependent suspension system is one where the two wheels on the same axle are connected by a rigid link.
              Compression force on one wheel will definitely affect the other. Road irregularities cause damage to every
              wheel rotation that occurs outside of the expected norm.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is primarily used in big trucks since it can withstand far more shocks than independent suspension
              systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              This system is illustrated by;
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <b>Beam Axle.</b>
          <p>
            A dependent suspension system connects two opposing tyres through a beam axle, and is typically utilized for
            the rear wheels. This system employs two leaf springs to secure and stabilize the rear axle.
            When one of the wheels moves up or down, it will influence the movement of the opposite wheel.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to a dependent suspension system that has a full bump, it does not affect certain aspects such
            as the track width, toe-in and camber. This means that there will be less wear and tear on the tyres, but it
            also means that the weight of the beam is considered to be unsprung weight and can result in a rough and bumpy
            ride.
            Furthermore, having a camber angle of zero can have a negative impact on the vehicle's ability to handle
            corners and turns.
          </p>
          <p>
  
            Even though they are easy to make, they cost lots of money.
          </p>
          <br>
          <b>Rigid Suspension (Leaf Spring)</b>
          <p>
            The leaf springs in the rigid suspension system are located close to the wheels and beneath the dampers, just
            like in the beam axle setup. These leaf springs, made of strong steel material, act as dampers and flex under
            the pressure applied by the vehicle's axle. They can handle heavy loads well, making them a preferred choice
            for commercial vehicles.
            However, they are not suitable for providing comfort during high-speed or sharp turns and may affect the
            vehicle's handling under such conditions.

          <b>Adaptive Suspension system.</b>
          <p>
            Adaptive Suspension system, also known as active suspension system, is a type of vehicle suspension that uses
            an onboard system to control the vertical movement of the vehicle's wheels. Unlike passive suspensions, active
            suspensions use actuators to independently raise and lower the chassis at each wheel. This allows the system
            to keep the vehicle's tyres perpendicular to the road in corners, improving traction and control.
            Active suspensions can greatly enhance a vehicle's ride quality, handling, and stability by reducing body roll
            and pitch variations in various driving situations. This technology uses sensors throughout the vehicle to
            detect body movement and an onboard computer to control the active and semi-active suspensions.

            optimal performance. However, it is important to note that the construction of this type of suspension is very
            complex, which sets it apart from other suspension systems.
            Additionally, the high level of technology and materials used in air suspension make it quite expensive

              <p>
                Inspecting your vehicle's suspension system is important for maintaining optimal driving comfort and
                safety.
                To inspect your vehicle's suspension system, you should check various components of your vehicle's
                suspension system.
                These include; inspecting the tyres for uneven wear and tear, checking the shocks and struts for any
                leaks,
                dents or damage, performing a bouncing test by pushing down the front or rear part of your vehicle and
                observe it bouncing back to the initial level.
                Additionally, you can also take your vehicle for a road test.
              </p>

                    Tie rod ends are responsible for your vehicle's steering wheel responsiveness. They help you maintain
                    control of the vehicle. When inspecting your vehicle's suspension system, you should also check the
                    status of the tie rod ends.
                    Worn out tie rod ends will cause difficulty in steering and maintaining control of your vehicle, thus
                    the ride will be uncomfortable.

                  <p>
                    If you are driving and all of a sudden your vehicle's steering wheel becomes non-responsive, the tie
                    rod
                    ends could be worn out or faulty.
                    Tie rods are responsible for the movement of your vehicle's front wheels at the same time. Worn out
                    tie
                    rods cause the steering wheel to loosen, your vehicle's tyres to wear out unevenly, and your vehicle
                    to

                          When testing the tie rod, it's best to remove the wheel. However, removing the wheel requires
                          loosening the lug nuts, which can only be done safely when the car is on the ground. To do this,
                          use a wheel spanner or another tool to break loose the nuts by giving them a quarter-turn
                          counterclockwise. It's important to keep the lug nuts on to prevent the wheel from coming off
                          while the car is on the ground. If the wheel does come off, it can be difficult to fix the
                          issue.It's worth noting that the lug nuts require a significant amount of force to loosen, which
                          makes it difficult to do while the car is jacked up. By loosening them slightly while the car is
                          on the ground, you will make it easier to remove the wheel when you need to. Just remember to
                          tighten the nuts back up once you are done testing the tie rod.It is important to take the
                          necessary precautions when working on your car to ensure your safety and prevent any damage to
                          your vehicle.
                          By following these steps, you can safely and effectively test the tie rod without any issues.

                          To remove the tyre, first remove the lug nuts by unscrewing them counterclockwise using your
                          hands
                          or a wheel spanner or wrench. Then, place your hands on either side of the wheel and grip the

                          end. Pull the wheel towards you by alternating left and right until it comes off the car. If the

                          In case the tyre is stuck due to rust, tap the tyre rim gently with a rubber mallet to help

                          Cars have two tie rods on each of their front wheels, namely the inner and outer tie rods. The
                          outer tie rod is identifiable as the black or silver part that is threaded onto the tyre end of
                          a
                          thin metal rod that stretches from the wheel to a black spring. The outer tie rod connects to a
                          round cap that is secured to the wheel with a nut.
                          This cap serves to protect and secure the tie rod to the wheel. It is important to note that the
                          tie rod will not last long without the cap in place.

                          If you happen to notice any damage or tear on the cap, it is important to inspect it closely.
                          You
                          can do this by gently pulling the cap apart with your hands and checking for any dirt or debris
                          inside.
                          Dirt and grit can cause damage to the tie rod, so it is important to replace it to keep your car
                          running smoothly.Additionally, it is possible to replace the boot of the tie rod when it gets
                          damaged.
                          However, it's only worth replacing if you catch any tears early on. If you wait too long and
                          dirt
                          gets inside the boot, it can cause damage to the entire outer rod.
                          Keeping an eye on the condition of the plastic cap and tie rod boot can help in ensuring your
                          car's longevity.

                          It is important to ensure that the tie rod is in good working condition for your safety while
                          driving.

                    <p>
                      When trying to access the inner tie rod, it may seem challenging due to the tyre being in the way.
                      To begin, use a wheel spanner to loosen the lug nuts while the car is still on the ground, but avoid
                      removing them at this stage.
                      Next, lift the tyre off the ground by using a Jack, then remove the lug nuts manually. Finally, pull
                      the tyre towards you to take it off the vehicle.It's important to ensure that your car is stable on
                      jack stands before attempting to reach underneath it.
                      Although you could access the inner rod with the wheel still attached, this can be difficult and
                      requires some skill.
                      However, if you remove the wheel, the rod is much easier to spot and access.

                    <p>
                      To locate the connection point between the outer and inner tie rods in a car, one can visually
                      follow
                      the outer tie rod from the wheel towards the center of the vehicle.
                      The outer tie rod acts like a cover for the smaller inner rod, which is threaded and connected at
                      the
                      end closest to the outer tie rod. The other end of the inner tie rod is joined with a black plastic
                      cap known as the rack boot, resembling a spring.
                      It should be noted that the inner tie rod is always smaller than the outer one and is connected to
                      the
                      end of the inner rod.

                    <p>
                      To ensure your car's steering system is functioning properly, it is important to inspect the parts
                      around the inner tie rod, including the rack boot that joins the rod to the car's steering shaft.
                      Look for any damage to the tie rod or tears in the rack boot, and replace them if necessary.
                      However,
                      the inner tie rod typically does not wear out as quickly as the outer one.
                      Therefore, if you experience any issues with your car's steering, it is more likely to be caused by
                      the outer tie rod, rack boot, or the steering column before the inner tie rod.
                      By inspecting these parts regularly, you can avoid more serious issues down the road.

                    <li data-roman="iv">Firmly hold the inner tie rod and shake to test its firmness.</li>
                    <p>
                      To check if the inner tie rod of your car needs to be replaced, reach underneath the car and move it
                      left and right.
                      It should not move much, but if it sways a lot, then it needs to be replaced. While checking, if you
                      hear any popping or unusual noises from anywhere except the rack boot, then it indicates a problem
                      with it.
                      Also, it is normal for the inner tie rod to spin silently.

                    <p>
                      Before removing the Jack, it is recommended to replace the wheel first. The Jack should be placed at
                      the jack point located behind the other wheel. Once the car is raised, reach under it to grab the
                      inner tie rod and check for any damages.
                      Shake it to see if it wobbles or creates any noise.Removing the inner tie rod is a bit more
                      complicated than the outer one. You will need a tie rod separator to detach it from the outer rod.
                      If you are unable to do it yourself, it is advisable to take it to a mechanic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It is not necessary to replace both inner rods simultaneously or replace them when installing new
                      outer rods.

                    <p>
                      In conclusion, tie rods are an important component of a vehicle's steering mechanism and must be
                      inspected regularly to ensure safety and efficiency on the road. Signs of wear or damage, such as
                      looseness or shaking while driving, should be addressed immediately and the tie rods should be
                      replaced if necessary.
                      Regular inspections and maintenance, as well as following the manufacturer's guidelines, can help
                      prevent costly repairs and ensure proper steering and handling of the vehicle. A diligent approach
                      to
                      tie rod maintenance can help keep drivers and passengers safe on the road.

                  <p>
                    You should inspect your shock absorbers and struts for any visible leakages, cracks, or dents. Examine
                    the springs. Look for any signs of damage such as cracks, bends, or deformities.
                    You should also ensure your vehicle has the right suspension springs, shock absorbers and struts as
                    stipulated on the vehicle's manual.

                    You can also conduct a bounce test by pushing down on each corner of your vehicle. A good suspension
                    system will bounce back up once and bring your vehicle to a stable rest.
                    If it continues to bounce unevenly, this could indicate worn out shock absorbers or struts.

                  <b>(E) Take your vehicle for a test drive.</b>
                  <p>
                    Finally, you can also take your vehicle for a test drive on tarmacked road surfaces so as to be able
                    to listen keenly for any unusual noises coming from your suspension system.
                    It is advisable to test your vehicle both on even and rough road surfaces so as to be able to tell the
                    differences and also explain to the mechanic what happens on both occasions.
                    It will also help you notice other faults that need repair such as loose bolts, hanging exhaust or
                    bumper.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In conclusion, it is advisable to conduct a self-inspection of the suspension system regularly. This
                    will help you identify any signs of fault with the suspension system early enough and save your
                    vehicle from further damages.
                    If you are unsure about how to perform a suspension system inspection, you should consult your
                    vehicle's manual or take it to a specialized mechanic for inspection.
